## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Click the chat bubble** in bottom-right corner
2. **Tell StreamBot what you need**: "I need a workflow that..."
3. **Answer follow-up questions**: Trigger, actions, conditions
4. **Assistant fills your prompt** and you click Generate!

### Example Conversation

```
User: "I need a workflow"

StreamBot: "I'd love to help! What should trigger your workflow?
           For example: a form submission, a scheduled time,
           a webhook from another app, or something else?"

User: "When someone submits a form"

StreamBot: "Great! What should happen after the form is submitted?
           For instance: send a confirmation email, create a ticket,
           save to a database, or notify your team?"

User: "Send an email and notify Slack"

StreamBot: "Perfect! Let me fill that prompt for you.
           I've prepared a workflow description - click Generate when ready!"

[Prompt auto-filled]: "Create an n8n workflow that triggers on form
submission, sends a confirmation email to the submitter, and posts a
notification to a Slack channel with the form details."
```

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variable

Add to `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note**: User requested to use `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` instead of the Claude API. Make sure this key is set before running the app.

## Cost Analysis

### GPT-4o Pricing (as of 2025)
- Input: ~$2.50 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$10.00 per 1M tokens

### Expected Usage
- Average conversation: 500 input + 150 output tokens
- Cost per conversation: ~$0.0026
- 1000 conversations/month: ~$2.60
- 10,000 conversations/month: ~$26.00

**Much cheaper than originally planned Claude Haiku!** GPT-4o is both faster and more cost-effective for this use case.

## Technical Decisions

### Why GPT-4o over Claude?
- User explicitly requested GPT (with VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY)
- GPT-4o is extremely fast (~300ms response time)
- Lower cost than originally planned
- Excellent for conversational tasks

### Why Context API over Props?
- Assistant widget is global (rendered in App.tsx)
- Generator page needs to receive prompts
- Context avoids prop drilling through multiple levels
- Clean separation of concerns

### Why 300 Max Tokens?
- Keeps responses concise (2-3 sentences ideal)
- Faster response times for users
- Lower costs
- Forces assistant to be helpful, not verbose
