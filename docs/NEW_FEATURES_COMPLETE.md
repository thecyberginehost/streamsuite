```

**For a workflow with disconnected nodes:**
```
Issues Found:
• Node "Send Email" appears to be disconnected

## 🗄️ Database Updates Required

### For Existing Databases

Run this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
-- Add status tracking columns
ALTER TABLE public.workflows
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('success', 'failed', 'pending'));

ALTER TABLE public.workflows
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS error_message TEXT;

-- Create index for status filtering
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_workflows_status ON public.workflows(status);
```

Or simply run: [SUPABASE_SETUP_UPDATE.sql](SUPABASE_SETUP_UPDATE.sql)
