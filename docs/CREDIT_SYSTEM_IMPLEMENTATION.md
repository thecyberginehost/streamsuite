## üîß How It Works

### Credit Costs

```typescript
CREDIT_COSTS = {
  WORKFLOW_GENERATION_SIMPLE: 1,   // Simple workflows (<50 words, no branches)
  WORKFLOW_GENERATION_COMPLEX: 2,  // Complex workflows (50+ words, has branches)
  WORKFLOW_DEBUG: 1,                // Debug and fix workflow
  TEMPLATE_DOWNLOAD: 0,             // Templates are free
}
```

### Smart Cost Estimation

The system automatically estimates if a workflow will be simple or complex based on:
- **Word count** in the prompt
- **Keywords** like "if", "when", "branch", "multiple"
- **Advanced features** like "ai", "agent", "langchain"

Example:
```typescript
// Simple (1 credit):
"Send an email when a form is submitted"

// Complex (2 credits):
"When a customer fills out the contact form, if they selected 'urgent' send an immediate Slack notification, otherwise add them to the email nurture sequence and schedule a follow-up in 3 days"
```

### Credit Deduction Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Clicks Generate] --> B{Has Enough Credits?}
    B -->|No| C[Show Insufficient Credits Error]
    B -->|Yes| D[Generate Workflow]
    D -->|Success| E[Deduct Credits]
    E --> F[Update Balance in DB]
    F --> G[Emit Credit Change Event]
    G --> H[TopBar Auto-Updates]
    H --> I{Low on Credits?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Show Warning]
    I -->|No| K[Done]
```

## üí° Features Implemented

### 1. Pre-Generation Credit Check ‚úÖ

**Before** generating/debugging, the system checks:
```typescript
const creditCost = estimateGenerationCost(prompt);
const hasCredits = await hasEnoughCredits(creditCost);

if (!hasCredits) {
  // Show error: "You need X credits but only have Y"
  return;
}
```

### 2. Post-Success Credit Deduction ‚úÖ

**After** successful generation:
```typescript
await deductCredits({
  amount: creditCost,
  operation_type: 'generation',
  description: 'Generated workflow: Create Slack automation...'
});
```

**Why deduct AFTER?**
- User only pays for successful operations
- If AI fails, no credits lost
- Fair and transparent

### 3. Real-Time Balance Updates ‚úÖ

Uses an event emitter pattern:
```typescript
// When credits change
creditEvents.emit();

// TopBar listens for changes
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = creditEvents.subscribe(() => {
    loadBalance(); // Refresh display
  });
  return unsubscribe;
}, []);
```

**Result:** Credit balance updates instantly without page refresh!

### 4. Low Credits Warnings ‚úÖ

After each operation, checks if user is low on credits:
```typescript
const warning = await getLowCreditsWarning();
// Returns:
// - "You have 2 credits remaining." (if < 5)
// - "You only have 1 credit remaining. Consider purchasing more." (if < 3)
// - "You're out of credits! Purchase more to continue." (if 0)
```

### 5. Out of Credits Handling ‚úÖ

When user tries to generate with 0 credits:
```
üí≥ Insufficient Credits
You need 1 credit to generate this workflow. Please purchase more credits to continue.
```

**User-friendly messages:**
- Clear explanation of what they need
- Call to action (purchase more)
- No confusing error codes

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Check Initial Balance
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/
2. Look at TopBar (top-right corner)
3. Should see: "5 credits" badge

### Test 2: Generate Simple Workflow (1 credit)
1. Go to Generator page
2. Enter prompt: "Send an email when form submitted"
3. Click "Generate"
4. After success, toast should say: "1 credit deducted"
5. TopBar should update to: "4 credits"

### Test 3: Generate Complex Workflow (2 credits)
1. Enter long prompt with "if/when/branch" keywords
2. Click "Generate"
3. Should say: "2 credits deducted"
4. TopBar updates to: "2 credits"

### Test 4: Low Credits Warning
1. Keep generating until you have < 5 credits
2. After generation, you'll see a second toast:
3. "Credit Balance: You have 2 credits remaining."

### Test 5: Out of Credits
1. Keep generating until 0 credits
2. Try to generate again
3. Should show error: "üí≥ Insufficient Credits"
4. Generation should NOT proceed

### Test 6: Debug Workflow (1 credit)
1. Go to Debugger page
2. Upload a workflow JSON
3. Click "Regenerate with Fixes"
4. After success: "1 credit deducted"
5. TopBar updates

### Test 7: Real-Time Balance Update
1. Open app in 2 browser tabs
2. In Tab 1: Generate a workflow
3. In Tab 2: TopBar should NOT update (different sessions)
4. Refresh Tab 2: Should show new balance

## üìä Database Integration

### Profiles Table (Required Columns)

```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  credits_remaining INTEGER DEFAULT 5,  -- ‚úÖ This is used
  subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'free', -- ‚úÖ This is used
  -- ... other columns
);
```

### Credit Transactions Table (Optional for MVP)

```sql
CREATE TABLE credit_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  amount INTEGER,               -- Positive = add, Negative = deduct
  operation_type TEXT,          -- 'generation', 'debug', 'purchase'
  description TEXT,
  workflow_id UUID REFERENCES workflows(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Note:** Transactions table is NOT required for MVP. Credit service handles its absence gracefully.

## üöÄ What Works Now

‚úÖ **Users start with 5 credits**
‚úÖ **Credits deduct on generation** (1-2 credits based on complexity)
‚úÖ **Credits deduct on debugging** (1 credit)
‚úÖ **Balance updates in real-time**
‚úÖ **Low credits warnings appear**
‚úÖ **Out of credits blocks operations**
‚úÖ **User-friendly error messages**
‚úÖ **Fair billing** (only charge for successful operations)

---

## ‚ùå What's NOT Implemented Yet

These are next steps:

1. **Credit Purchase Flow** (Stripe integration)
   - User clicks "Buy Credits" button
   - Checkout page
   - Payment processing
   - Auto-add credits after purchase

2. **Subscription Plans** (Free/Pro/Agency)
   - Monthly credit allocations
   - Tier-based features
   - Upgrade/downgrade flows

3. **Credit Rollover** (up to 50% of plan limit)
   - Track unused credits
   - Roll over to next month
   - Cap at 50% of plan

4. **Transaction History Page**
   - View all credit purchases
   - View all credit usage
   - Download invoices

---

## üîÆ Next Steps for MVP

To complete monetization, implement:

1. **Pricing Page** (3-4 hours)
   - Show Free, Pro, Agency tiers
   - Feature comparison table
   - "Upgrade" buttons

2. **Stripe Integration** (4-6 hours)
   - Set up Stripe account
   - Create checkout session
   - Handle webhooks
   - Add credits after payment

3. **Settings Page** (2-3 hours)
   - View credit balance
   - View transaction history
   - Manage subscription
   - Purchase more credits

**Total Time:** 10-15 hours to complete monetization

## üìù Usage Examples

### For Developers

**Check if user has enough credits:**
```typescript
import { hasEnoughCredits } from '@/services/creditService';

const canProceed = await hasEnoughCredits(2);
if (!canProceed) {
  // Show error
}
```

**Deduct credits after operation:**
```typescript
import { deductCredits } from '@/services/creditService';

await deductCredits({
  amount: 1,
  operation_type: 'generation',
  description: 'Generated email automation workflow'
});
```

**Add credits (after purchase):**
```typescript
import { addCredits } from '@/services/creditService';

await addCredits(50, 'Purchased Pro Plan (50 credits)');
```

**Get credit balance:**
```typescript
import { getCreditBalance } from '@/services/creditService';

const { credits_remaining, subscription_tier } = await getCreditBalance();
console.log(`You have ${credits_remaining} credits (${subscription_tier} plan)`);
```
