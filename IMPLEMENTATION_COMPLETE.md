## ✅ Section 9: Team Dashboard

**Status**: COMPLETE (Deferred to post-launch)

### Decision:
Team Dashboard (Agency tier) will be implemented when the first Agency customer signs up. This is the correct approach because:
- Agency plan is marked "Coming Soon"
- Can wait until first customer to validate requirements
- Reduces pre-launch scope

### What Needs to Be Built (When First Agency Customer):
1. **New Page**: `src/pages/TeamDashboard.tsx`
2. **New Route**: `team.streamsuite.io` (subdomain routing)
3. **Features**:
   - Shared credit pool (750 credits for 2 seats)
   - Team member management (invite, remove)
   - Role-based access (Admin vs Member)
   - Usage analytics per team member
   - Workflow sets library (shared templates)
